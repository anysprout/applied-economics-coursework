Applied Economics Coursework

This repository contains selected coding-based projects completed as part of my MA in Applied Economics. The work spans time series forecasting, econometric modeling, cost-effectiveness analysis, and applied data engineering using Python, R, and SAS.

Projects emphasize reproducibility, structured data workflows, statistical inference, and practical modeling applications.

Each folder corresponds to a specific course or major assignment and includes source code, notebooks, and supporting documentation where appropriate.
